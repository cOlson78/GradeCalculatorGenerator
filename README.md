# GradeCalculatorGenerator

For my college classes, I like to create my own grade calculators in Java to predict my grades. 

This Java program asks the user some questions in the console, and creates another Java file that has all the information needed for a grade calculator program.

For the outputted files themselves, each score will need to be put in manualy through the code itself. Besides that, it works as intended.
